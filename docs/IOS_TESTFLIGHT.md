# iPhone push via TestFlight (paid Apple Developer, no Mac)

Use this instead of **Sideloadly** when you need **push notifications**. Sideloadly cannot use your paid push certificates properly.

## What you need

- **Paid Apple Developer** account (you have this)
- **Codemagic** account connected to this repo
- **Firebase** project `carzo-prod` with **APNs .p8 key** uploaded (Cloud Messaging → `com.carzo.app`)
- **Render** backend running (`https://carr-5hrm.onrender.com`)
- iPhone with **TestFlight** app installed (free from App Store)

## 1) Apple Developer Portal (browser)

1. [Identifiers](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list) → **com.carzo.app** (create if missing).
2. Enable capability **Push Notifications** → Save.
3. Note your **Team ID** (10 characters, e.g. `LN3R46L4H8`) — must match `ios/ExportOptions.plist`.

## 2) Firebase (browser)

1. [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com) → project **carzo-prod**.
2. **Project settings** → **Cloud Messaging** → Apple app **com.carzo.app**.
3. Upload **APNs Authentication Key** (.p8) + Key ID + Team ID.

## 3) App Store Connect (browser)

1. [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com) → **Apps** → **+** → new app **CARZO**, bundle ID **com.carzo.app**.
2. You do not need a store listing finished to use TestFlight.

## 4) Codemagic integrations (one-time)

### A. App Store Connect API key

1. [App Store Connect → Users and Access → Integrations → App Store Connect API](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/access/integrations/api) → **+** generate key.
2. Role: **App Manager** (or Admin).
3. Download `.p8`, note **Issuer ID** and **Key ID**.

In **Codemagic** → your app → **Teams** (or account) → **Integrations** → **App Store Connect**:

- Add the API key (Issuer ID, Key ID, upload `.p8`).
- Remember the **integration name** (e.g. `Carzo ASC`).

### B. Apple Developer Portal (code signing) — required

Codemagic → **Team settings** (not only the app) → **Integrations** → **Developer Portal**:

- Connect with the **same** Apple ID that owns your paid developer team.
- Role must be **Admin** or **App Manager** so profiles can be created.

### C. Register the bundle ID in Apple (if missing)

1. [developer.apple.com → Identifiers](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list)
2. **+** → **App IDs** → bundle ID **`com.carzo.app`** (exact spelling).
3. Enable **Push Notifications** (and **Associated Domains** if you use universal links).
4. Save.

### D. App in App Store Connect

App Store Connect → **Apps** → app with bundle ID **`com.carzo.app`** must exist (you created CARZO + SKU earlier).

## 5) Fix “No matching profiles found for com.carzo.app”

Often shows at **Initializing build** — Codemagic has no App Store profile yet.

### A. Add App Store Connect API key (required)

1. [Create API key](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/access/integrations/api) (role **App Manager**).
2. Codemagic → **Teams** → **Team integrations** → **Developer Portal** → **Manage keys** → **Add key**
3. Issuer ID + Key ID + upload **.p8**
4. Name must match `codemagic.yaml`: `app_store_connect: App Store Connect` (or change yaml to your name)

### B. Create signing in Codemagic UI (do once) — fixes “without certificate private key”

**Team settings** → **codemagic.yaml settings** → **Code signing identities**

#### Certificates — use **Generate**, NOT **Fetch**

**Fetch certificates** from Apple **does not** download the private key → builds fail with  
`Cannot save Signing Certificates without certificate private key`.

1. **iOS certificates** → **Generate certificate** (not Fetch)
   - Type: **Apple Distribution**
   - App Store Connect API key: yours
   - **Reference name:** `carzo_distribution` (must match `codemagic.yaml`)
2. If you already used **Fetch certificates**, remove them under **Available certificates** and **Generate** a new one instead.

#### Provisioning profile

3. **iOS provisioning profiles** → **Fetch profiles**
   - **App Store profiles** → **com.carzo.app**
   - **Reference name:** `carzo_appstore` (must match `codemagic.yaml`)
   - **Download selected**

The profile must be **saved in Codemagic** with a **green certificate** link. If the table shows **Certificate: Not uploaded**, Codemagic will **not** register `carzo_appstore` and the build says:

`No provisioning profile with reference 'carzo_appstore' were found … Available options are: carzo_distribution`

**Fix:** recreate App Store profile on Apple using the **May 23, 2027** Distribution cert, re-upload `.mobileprovision`, confirm **Certificate = OK**, then rebuild.

`codemagic.yaml` uses `distribution_type: app_store` + `bundle_identifier: com.carzo.app` so any valid uploaded App Store profile for that bundle is picked up (not only the name `carzo_appstore`).

### B2. Optional: upload `.p12` instead of Generate

If you have a **Distribution .p12** that includes a private key (exported from a Mac):

1. **Code signing identities** → **iOS certificates** → **Upload**
2. Reference name: `carzo_distribution`

### B3. Optional: `CERTIFICATE_PRIVATE_KEY` env var (advanced)

Only if you prefer CLI `--create` on every build:

1. On a PC (once): `openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out ios_distribution_private_key.pem -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048`
2. Codemagic → app → **Environment variables** → group `code-signing` → secret **`CERTIFICATE_PRIVATE_KEY`** = entire `.pem` file (including `BEGIN` / `END` lines)
3. Add group `code-signing` to the TestFlight workflow in Codemagic UI if not in yaml

Use the **same** key every time or Apple will create extra distribution certificates (max 3).

### C. Apple

- App ID **com.carzo.app** with **Push Notifications**
- App Store Connect app with same bundle ID

### D. Rebuild **iOS TestFlight (signed, push enabled)**

Log must pass: **Set up keychain and apply UI signing files** → **Apply code signing profiles** → **Build IPA**

- **Cannot save Signing Certificates without certificate private key** → you used **Fetch certificates**; delete those and **Generate certificate** (section B), reference name `carzo_distribution`
- **No matching profiles** at init → profile `carzo_appstore` missing or wrong reference name in yaml
- **401 / invalid key** → fix API key in step A
- **Too many distribution certificates** → revoke old at [developer.apple.com](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates/list), generate again in Codemagic

## 6) Fix workflow integration name

Open `codemagic.yaml` → workflow **`ios-testflight`**.

Change:

```yaml
integrations:
  app_store_connect: Carzo ASC   # ← your exact integration name from step 4A
```

Commit and push if you change the name.

## 7) Run the TestFlight build

1. Codemagic → **Workflows** → **iOS TestFlight (signed, push enabled)**.
2. Branch **main** → **Start new build**.
3. Wait until green (first time may take ~15–25 min).
4. Build uploads to App Store Connect automatically (`submit_to_testflight: true`).

**Upload error “bundle version must be higher than previously uploaded version: 1”** — Apple already has build **1**. Each new upload needs a higher **CFBundleVersion**. The workflow uses Codemagic **`CM_BUILD_ID`** as the iOS build number so this does not repeat.

### Archive built but no `.ipa` (only `Runner.xcarchive` in logs)

Codemagic must export with **`$HOME/export_options.plist`** created by **`xcode-project use-profiles`**. Do **not** use `ios/ExportOptions.plist` on CI — it lacks provisioning profile mappings, so archive succeeds and export fails.

The workflow on `main` uses `--export-options-plist="$HOME/export_options.plist"` and retries `xcodebuild -exportArchive` if needed.

### Build green but no `.ipa` download?

1. On the build page, scroll to **Artifacts** (below the step list). If empty, open **Build IPA for TestFlight** and search the log for `Built IPA to` or `export`.
2. **Publishing** under 1 second usually means no IPA was found — nothing was uploaded to TestFlight yet.
3. Re-run the workflow after the latest `main` (the build step **fails** if no `.ipa` is produced).
4. Still check [App Store Connect → TestFlight](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com) in case an older build is processing.

## 7b) App Encryption Documentation (App Store Connect popup)

If TestFlight asks what encryption your app uses, choose:

**None of the algorithms mentioned above**

CARZO only uses standard HTTPS/TLS and Apple’s built-in crypto (API calls, Firebase, etc.) — not custom/proprietary encryption.

For **future uploads**, `ios/Runner/Info.plist` includes `ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption` = `false` so Apple usually skips this dialog.

## 8) Install on iPhone

1. Install **TestFlight** from the App Store.
2. App Store Connect → your app → **TestFlight** → wait for build **Processing** → **Ready to test** (often 10–30 min after upload).
3. Add yourself as **Internal testing** tester (same Apple ID as developer team).
4. Open TestFlight on iPhone → install **CARZO**.

## 9) Test push

1. Open CARZO (TestFlight build, **not** Sideloadly) → log in → allow **notifications**.
2. **Log out → log in again** on the iPhone (registers FCM token on the server).
3. Put the iPhone app in the **background** (home screen) or **force-quit** it — do not keep the chat screen open while testing.
4. From another account (emulator is fine), send a chat message **to the iPhone account**.
5. You should see a **banner** on the iPhone within a few seconds.

### Still no push?

| Check | What to do |
|--------|------------|
| **Firebase APNs** | [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com) → **carzo-prod** → Project settings → Cloud Messaging → Apple app **com.carzo.app** → **APNs Authentication Key (.p8)** uploaded |
| **Render backend** | Render → **carr-5hrm** → Environment → **`FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`** = full Firebase Admin JSON (one line). Redeploy after adding. |
| **Token on server** | iPhone user must **re-login** after TestFlight install so `firebase_token` is saved. |
| **Render logs** | After sending a message, look for `FCM send failed` or `FCM skipped: … no firebase_token` |
| **Foreground** | Banners while the app is open require the latest build; background test is the reliable check |

If no banner: Render logs for `firebase_token` / `FCM send failed`; confirm APNs key in Firebase.

## Sideloadly vs TestFlight

| | Sideloadly | TestFlight |
|---|------------|------------|
| Needs Mac | No | No (Codemagic builds) |
| Push notifications | No | Yes (with steps above) |
| Expires | 7 days (free Apple ID sign) / varies | TestFlight build validity |

Keep Sideloadly for quick UI tests; use **TestFlight** for push and pre-release QA.
